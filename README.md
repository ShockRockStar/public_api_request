# public_api_request
 Fetch data from an API to populate 12 random employees. 

For this project I received data from a fetch API request. I check the status of HTTP request and return a Promise to resolve the host or reject if response is not ok.

I implement asynchronous code to get data of employees. 

In order to display user data I add HTML to the page by inserting in innerHTML and appending userCard to the Gallery. I call an eventListener on the userCard.

For this project I implemented a nice modal pop up window, taking into account the employees date of birth. For the modal window I also add HTML by inserting into the modalWindow div. 

There is functionality to see the previous and next employee card. 

There is also search funcationaility in this project via the search function. 

I added some css styling directly in the JavaScript file.
